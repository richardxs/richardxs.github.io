    <h2> What Is Fuel Efficiency and Why Is It Important? </h2>

    <p>
        With gas price through the roof nowadays, people have been changing traveling behaviors and have shown increasing interests in cars with a 
        higher fuel efficiency. <u> Fuel efficiency is defined as a measure of how much a car will convert energy in fuel into kinetic energy to travel </u>. 
        In other words, fuel efficiency shows how far your car can travel with a certain amount of fuel. In United States, <u>fuel efficiency is evaluated 
        by "miles per gallon" (MPG)</u>. Vehicles with better fuel efficiency tend to have a higher MPG value. Therefore, reducing wasted fuel. 
        Choosing a fuel efficient vehicle can bring a wide range of advantages: saving fuel costs, reducing carbon footprint, 
        cutting our dependence on oil, etc. 
    </p>

    <h3> Save Money on Gas</h3>
    <p>
        Oil prices are one of the major issues facing drivers today. Given the rising prices of fuel, it's probably time for you to consider saving money on 
        gas. The gas mileage, the amount of gas your car consumes per mile, plays an important role in how much money you save on gas each year. According to 
        some economists, you might save 4,500 USD for 5 years by driving a vehicle that gets 30 mpg rather than 20 mpg . Thus, if you start trying to drive a 
        more fuel-efficient car and use less fuel, not only will you save a lot of money, but you can also spend that saved money on something more meaningful 
        to you instead.
    </p>
    
    <h3> Reduce Carbon Footprint</h3>
    <p>
        While you can try plenty of little things in your daily lives to reduce your carbon footprint, driving a car with better fuel efficiency is undoubtedly 
        the best way to fight climate change. A recent study found that driving a more fuel efficient vehicle is by far the most realistic and effective action to
         achieve the largest cuts in emissions. The research says a car that gets 30 mpg would reduce total emissions by 5% than a vehicle that gets 20 mpg. 
         So, if you want to contribute to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, buying a car that boasts better gas mileage may be the best option.
    </p>

    <h3> Lower Dependence On Oil </h3>
    <p>
        According to statistics, over 70% of total U.S. on-road vehicles consume oil, and they account for nearly a fourth of the country's emissions, contributing to
        climate change. Moreover, the country paid about 120 million USD in 2014  for overseas oil, which was mainly imported from the Middle East. By owning a fuel 
        efficient vehicle, you can reduce dependence on oil, as well as save money for both yourself and your country.
