        Although electric cars outperform their fossil fuel countperparts in fuel efficiency, 
        customers still need to consider other factors including size, easy access to gas stations and financial reasons. 
        Nowadays most car makers manufacture 4-cylinder gasoline cars because they are cheap, spacious and there is no shortage 
        of gas stations. To provide guidance on selecting cars, the following plot compares different brands in regards to 
        their average city and highway MPG.

    <p><b>Scene 3: </b>
        Both the Average City MPG/Highway MPG plots suggest that Japanese and Korean cars tend to have a higher MPG, suggesting that
         they are more fuel efficient. But the differences are relatively small between different brands, showing that 4-cylinder
        gasoline cars are usually fuel efficient;
