        Fuel efficiency is commonly evaluated by miles per gallon (MPG), and the following figure plots
        average highway MPG vs. average city MPG for common automobile brands. The size of bubble is
        proportinal to the number of cylinders.

    <p><b>Scene 1: </b>
        Cars with a high average highway MPG usually also enjoy a high average city MPG, which makes them fit into 
        "fuel-efficient" category. In addition, electric cars have much higher MPGs than disel and gasoline counterparts. 
        Furthermore, the size of bubbles indicate that an automobile with a higher number of cylinders tends to have a lower
        MPG, suggesting that it is less fuel efficient. <u>More details on the impact of number of cylinders on fuel efficiency
        will be shown in next scene. </u>
